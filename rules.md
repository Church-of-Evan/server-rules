**SERVER RULES:**

**Chat:**

1Ô∏è‚É£  **Be respectful of other people.** Sexism, racism, or other forms of derogatory speech are not tolerated. No personal attacks and harassments are allowed.
    ‚Ä¢ This includes discussions about instructors/professors. It's OK to discuss the pros and cons of different professors' classes and teaching styles. It's not OK to personally attack professors for, for instance, bad teaching.
    ‚Ä¢ It also includes heated discussions on programming languages, text editors, and other such "hot topics" in programming. It is fine to discuss the merits of different technologies, but do not insult people based on their choice of language/editor/etc.

2Ô∏è‚É£  **Keep invites to OSU students, alumni, or faculty.** This is only a semi-public server. Do not post invite links publicly.

3Ô∏è‚É£  **All posts must be SFW.** No gore, porn, suggestive content, etc.

4Ô∏è‚É£  **This is not a general politics Discord server.** If you want to talk about any important political point(s), we encourage you do so on DAM Political <https://discord.gg/S3Sk23ffEE>, another student-run OSU Discord.

5Ô∏è‚É£  Keep casual conversations out of specific/class-help channels.

6Ô∏è‚É£  Keep bot commands to the ü§ñ-bot-commands channel.

**Moderation**:

7Ô∏è‚É£  **<@&694642088314142762> are moderators.** They enforce the rules as written here and have the final say.

8Ô∏è‚É£  **We use a 1-strike policy system.** You will be given a strike by a moderator for the first offence. A second offense will result in a ban.

9Ô∏è‚É£  If you have a problem with someone or would like to report an incident, **DM a moderator about it.** Do not involve the whole server in a confrontation.

üîü  Someone else breaking these rules **does not give you permission to break them.**

To reduce clutter, class channels are role-based.  You can opt-in to any class channel by using the !role command in ü§ñ-bot-commands. There is also an allclasses role to see all classes.
If we have missed a CS/ECE class, let us know and we will add it!

If you have questions for non-CS/ECE classes, use general-homework-help or ask in a more specific server -- check out the OSU Discord Directory https://discord.gg/KnCzPPZvvq.

This is not a mental health discord. We would love to help you, but we are not trained to help and run a large risk of hurting you instead. If you came here for mental help, we ask that you go to https://counseling.oregonstate.edu/ for help.
If you are in immediate crisis, please contact the Crisis Text Line by texting OREGON to 741-741 or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).
