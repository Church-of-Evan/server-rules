**To reduce clutter, class channels are role-based.**  You can opt-in to any class channel by using the `!role` command in <#694654988089294943>. There is also an `allclasses` role to see all classes.
If we have missed a CS/ECE class, let us know and we will add it!

If you have questions for non-CS/ECE classes, use <#694642886935052429> or ask in a more specific server -- check out the OSU Discord Directory https://discord.gg/KnCzPPZvvq.
